                            As we have entered into Industry 4.0, it has broken the conventional methods of
                industrialization and employed new techniques which creates a metamorphosis from
                older days. In this fast moving world, the industry should also transform with required
                change which is the need of the hour. The methodologies employed for this not only
                saves time but also fosters the workforce and work environment, increases
                competitiveness in the industry, reduces the burden of productivity and economical
                margin increases to a high peak. The implementation of CPPS, the networking of all
                systems, are more used during Industry 4.0. Now even manufacturing and production
                become autonomous. This had brought changes in information and communication
                technologies. Machines becoming autonomous helps us in making a machine an
                independent structure, thus collecting and analyzing data becomes easier.

                              Robotics is a promising area working for the advancement of tomorrow. As the
                technology is transforming, automation naturally will uplift the current standards of our
                life. As the technology is advancing more, automation naturally will uplift the current
                standards of our life. Thus robots reaching our home are not far away. Robotics in
                future can be seen in various sectors like education, healthcare, public security etc.
                Implementation of educational robotics in the education sector will see virtual reality
                learning with personalized training. In the medical field by the introduction of
                telepresence, physicians can use robots to help them in examining the patients and
                treating them even in remote areas. Robot assisted surgeries and virtual nursing can
                lead to the elimination of human errors or treatment delay due to the unavailability of
                human staff. With the outbreak of dreadful diseases like Corona, Nippah, Ebola etc, the
                significance of sanitation and disinfectant has increased resulting in more human power
                for the prescribed area. Here also we can implement robotics.

              The presence of Artificial Intelligence is inevitable in the present and future too. From
              Alexa to self-driving cars, the footprints of AI are visible around us. The advent of AI
              shows the inevitability of acquiring new skills for adapting with the new market trend.
              Studies say that networked artificial intelligence is amplifying human effectiveness. In
              the medical field, diagnosing and treating patients using AI is inexorable. In the
              transportation sector, AI is used in prediction and detection of traffic jams and accidents
              thereby ensuring more road safety and resolving control problems. In the banking
              sector, AI will confirm better customer support and enhanced banking service. Another
              major advantage is as a human he can work for only a defined time hours but AI
              machines are not restrained from working, ie they can work for 24*7 hours which make
              the work easier. Digital assistance and helping in repetitive jobs helps the society from
              monotonous routine. Importance of AI in the education sector now sees virtual reality
              learning with personalized training. Easy grading software and real time problem solving
              assessment is also seen in this sector

              Kevin Ashton said “The internet of things has the potential to change the world, just
              as the internet did, maybe more so”. Since the technology is still growing it facilitates
              further research and development in this field. A knowledge sharing platform is created
              which makes man more creative to sustain in this field by creating new innovation
              opportunities. The Internet of Things(IoT) has made impacts in agriculture and has an
              influential impact in our daily lives. In agriculture, a field which now struggles a lot, IoT
              can be used to collect data which precisely gives an eyesight towards the weather
              conditions, choosing the best crop for next season, nutrition changes to be provided to
              the soil etc. Simple example of the same is the proximity sensors attached in the
              vehicles which gives us an idea about the distance between ours and adjacent vehicles.
              Similarly IoT is turning into the Internet of People(IoP) which will be an optimistic
              change for the future.

              Another important change or upgradation in technology is the arrival of Network
              Slicing. It will revolutionize the network system of tomorrow in a great and good pace.
              Network Slicing is a method to define a virtual or logical form of network architecture
              which is a widely used technique that comes under the family of software defined
              networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). It utilizes cloud computing
              and edge computing in its methodology. This method enables service providers to
              create a strong network connectivity depending upon the need by creating different
              slices of its own architecture, management and security for serving the purpose. Using it
              for different smart services leads to the call for varied communication networks and
              computing technologies at the infrastructure layer. Capability of meeting a mix of
              diverse requirements at the same time makes network slicing different from existing
              network techniques. SDN offers effective management of the network functions. Quality
              of services that have been existing for years is entirely different from network slicing and
              later one is more advantageous than the former. Thus this technology can bring new
              customer experience depending upon the end user. Also Network slicing has been
              identified as the backbone of emerging 5G technology which opens a field for research.

              Similar changes can be seen from Big Data analysis which helps in interpreting the
              exponential growth in the amount of data. Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning are
              two key concepts which are the trends of this technological era. The implementation of
              big data analytics can be seen in companies like Google and Amazon, as this is the
              best and efficient way for companies to get the data they need and to verify easily. As
              the usage of wireless networks increases especially in this pandemic period, the
              amount of data flow is at an exponential rate. As the data trafficking is escalating, the
              importance of implementation of data analytics has great significance too which implies
              the further demand of the same in future. Another method of data analysis is Machine
              Learning, which is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. This is also a technique which helps
              us to understand the data, explore it and helps in making decisions within limited time
              and human intervention.

              In the business sector, Blockchain is and will be the best method for protection
              and authentication of data. As data is money, cyber security is a promising field in terms
              of the job market. Though quantum computing is restricted to a limited area, it will
              expand in this decade itself. By reducing production costs and making it environment
              friendly, 3D printing helped to simplify complex forms into simpler ones. 3D printing is
              used in almost all industries as it reduces the supplier dependency too. Smart sensors
              is a technology that provides notifications to employees through systems on machines.
              Additive manufacturing is the main contribution to environmental industry 4.0. This field
              requires a high degree of innovation and perfect measure of utilization of resources.
              Augmented reality is a very important application in this field as it can look into planning
              and simulation before being used. One of the major research fields is cloud
              manufacturing which integrates cloud computing. Also it paved the way for Innovation
              4.0.

              As the energy consumption is increasing at an exponential rate especially in a
              developing country like India, the need for renewable energy resources is the need of
              the hour because it has the ability to shape the future in terms of energy efficiency and
              economic growth. As we move into renewable energy it will improve energy security and
              availability at cheaper rates. Employing solar and wind energy can revolutionize the
              electricity production sector. Now the government is giving subsidies for solar panels.
              Usage of this reduces the release of harmful gases including carbon dioxide. Biofuels, a
              renewable energy source, are generated from organic matter and wastes. As the
              country is facing a major problem with air index it is a good step towards reduction in
              harmful gas emission. This will also minimize waste generation. Even the main aim of
              Goal 7 in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal is to ensure affordable,
              clean and reliable energy sources.
