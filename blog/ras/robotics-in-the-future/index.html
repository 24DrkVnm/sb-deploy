              “Robotics and other combinations will make the world pretty fantastic
              compared with today” - Bill Gates
            </h5>

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
              Robots and robotics are two words which were once an alien to us and now
              became a part of our life. From space to earth, the footprints of
              robotics are visible now in all sectors. The increase in advancement in
              this field has changed the world around us in a short span. In home, for
              automobile assembly, mining and exploring and there are many more
              sectors where the fingerprints of this technology can be seen. The scope
              of robotics in a developing and developed country is really huge as it
              can increase in production and accuracy of the products.
            </p>

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
              Now this field is trying to create more robots to look, feel, act and
              react like a real human. Using electronic skin, it could give robots a
              sensational feel of touch. A time where rather than robots as a machine
              it will turn into robots as a friend and even a pet too is not so far.
              For the better future of robotics, Artificial Intelligence plays an
              important role in it. For enhancing better robotic performance,
              efficient codes are to be needed. In the future it is possible to see
              robots themselves will do most of the coding. The major concern which
              everyone has is whether robots will steal the job or not. But the fact
              is humans are still way smarter than robotic brains. It is the creative
              brains of us that lead to the better robots of tomorrow. The advent of
              robotics shows the inevitability of acquiring new skills for adapting
              with the new market trend opening more job opportunities in the market.
            </p>

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
              The future of robots mainly depends on how we make them, use them and
              utilize them efficiently. Major change will be that it will boost our
              standard of living. Automation and mechanization had already changed our
              lifestyle to a better and different way enabling us to utilize more time
              efficiently. Similarly as the technology is advancing more, automation
              naturally will uplift the current standards of our life. Thus robots
              reaching our home are not far away. Statistics show that if corona had
              not visited us, the global economy would have increased seven fold
              resulting in more investments in this field for improving this sector.
              But in another aspect, corona had also taught us the importance of the
              need for specialized robots which efficiently work in this pandemic
              situation. It is because the spread of these types of diseases could be
              controlled to a greater limit if robots are used.
            </p>
            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
              Thus robotics in future can be seen in various sectors like education, healthcare,
              public security etc. Understanding the importance of imparting knowledge on robotics,
              now this has been included from secondary school levels. The need for polished and
              better brains for future leads to this change. Implementation of educational robotics in
              the education sector now sees virtual reality learning with personalized training. Easy
              grading software and real time problem solving assessment will become a new trend.
              Another major advantage is as a human he/she can work for only a defined time hours
              but robots are not restrained from working, ie they can work for 24*7 hours which make
              the work easier. Thus assisting the children and solving their problems will be possible
              at any time. Robots can even be programmed to suit each individual need. For children
              with special needs a constant companion will help them mentally too.
            </p>

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
              In the medical field we can probably see a drastic change by the appearance of
              robotics. By the introduction of telepresence, physicians can use robots to help them in
              examining the patients and treating them even in remote areas. Robot assisted
              surgeries and virtual nursing can lead to the elimination of human errors or treatment
              delay due to the unavailability of human staff. With the outbreak of dreadful diseases
              like Corona, Nippah, Ebola etc, the significance of sanitation and disinfectant has
              increased resulting in more human power for the prescribed area. Here also we can
              implement robotics.

            </p>

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
                            As the public safety and security become streaming through news channels
              everyday with a variety of news, the implementation of robotics in this sector in future
              has great seriousness. Tireless patrol robots and robots for detection of traffic jams and
              accidents thereby ensuring more road safety and resolving control problems will be
              seen. Security robots and unmanned systems can not only be implemented in traffic
              systems but also can help in the military field too. Drones are one such example of a
              present situation. Progression in this technology can impact in rapid response whenever
              a crisis is visible. It can be employed in combat support application, for material removal
              etc.

            </p>
            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
                            As the robot revolution is on the way, it will also revolutionize the agriculture industry.
              According to many researchers and studies it is said that the agricultural robots should
              have an annual growth rate of 20% until 2022. Automated tractors or robots, feeder
              robots etc which are visible in limited amounts will be seen in larger numbers in near
              future. This technology can be implemented in harvesting management, irrigation
              management, soil management etc. Finding the perfect fertilizer in the correct quantity
              will be easily determined using the specialised robots for justifying this need. Now
              looking into the banking sector, robotics can confirm better customer support and
              enhanced banking service. It can be classified into customer service and banking
              inside service. By making it more user friendly, robotics can help in banking as a safer
              and easier mode.

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
                            In the construction field, a highly non automated industry requires construction
              robots which can have a greater impact in production, improving the quality and safety
              of work. However it can lead to a decrease in human labour in some areas which results
              in an increase in job loss for unskilled people. Surveillance, surveying and inspection
              can be easily done by the employment of robotics. Robotic communication is another
              emerging area where studies are still progressing.</p>

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
                            Similarly the presence will be seen in different sectors in near future. In short the
              effect of Robotics in mankind is going to have a new face. It is used to build a
              sustainable and environmentally friendly technological world which will be creating a
              new technological space. To boost productivity and creativity of humans, bring up new
              changes and solve existing challenges, Robotics can bring a new face to the
              technological world. For every problem there lies a solution and lets together find them
              effectively and move along with this new technological era.
