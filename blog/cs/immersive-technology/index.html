                  Our lives have changed tremendously during the past few months, how we
                  are living today was not the same scenario a few months back. One of the
                  worst infectious pandemics that we are dealing with has brought large
                  economic loss whole over the world. As compared to the initial days of
                  lockdown and social distancing people have adapted a lot with the current
                  situation. This pandemic on the other side has opened up a new way to the
                  virtual world that is beyond zoom calls and virtual summits. The immersive
                  technologies including AR, VR, MR, and XR will bring up the new era of
                  reality.

              <u>Unity and  Microsoft Hololens2 have helped Toyota come up with new improvements</u>

            </h5>

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
                            Toyota is trying to accomplish its motto kaizen (continuous improvement)
              by using Unity’s real-time 3D development platform and Microsoft
              Hololens2. Starting from conducting training sessions to developing
              stunningly realistic car configurations for its luxury Lexus brand they have
              made use of mixed reality.
            </p>

            <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
              Since 2005 3D modeling was used in Toyota for global marketing. By
              making use of mixed reality the major changes that they have brought
              recently include:

            <ul class="jak-light blog-para pt-2" style="list-style: disc;">

                    <li> Electric wiring diagram: - instead of 2D diagrams entire 3D electrical
                    diagrams were available.</li>
                    <li> Guidance of work procedure: - instructions for working can be seen
                    on a hologram in which it is virtually stated, which helped engineers
                    reduce 90% manpower.</li>
                    <li> Function explanation: - now it is easy to explain the functionality of
                    hidden mechanisms within the vehicle, by using hololens2 and unity.</li>
                    <li> Design review: - the real-time CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
                    analysis can be done on a vehicle and the user can analyze and
                    simulate how its design affects the aerodynamics.</li>
                    <li>Check operation: - by using unity, hololens2, and machine learning,
                    engineers can recognize errors that are missed by ordinary
                    inspection, thereby reducing human errors to a greater extent.</li>
                    <li>Data preparation: - they have used PiXYZ and unity for the pipeline,
                    PiXYZ has made the data lighter and data exchange easy.</li>

                          These are some of the areas where immersive technologies like mixed
            reality have paved a better path for kaizen (continuous improvement) in the
            automotive lifecycle of Toyota.

            <u>Mixed Reality – Technology for the new normal</u>

          </h5>

          <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
           
          
            Not just in the case of Toyota, immersive technologies including
            augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and the extended reality
            have expanded their scope to almost all areas of life which include health
            care, product designing, and testing, travel and tourism, simulation and
            digital twin creation. These are the technologies, which have huge industry
            potential and features large application space.

          
           </p>
           <p class="jak-light blog-para pt-2">
           
          
            Even though augmented, as well as virtual reality, had been developed
            earlier, they were limited to video games and entertainment. But in the
            current scenario, it is not the same. These are the times when work from
            home, immersive entertainment, distance learning, networked social
            interactivity, and home-based fitness has gained more importance, which
            portrays the essentiality of a technology that will support the growth of the
            economy irrespective of social distancing. During these hard times, these
            technologies will provide a platform for people to stay connected virtually
            but distanced socially. So as of now and for the culminating time's
            immersive technologies like AR, VR, MR, and XR proves to be very
            essential.
