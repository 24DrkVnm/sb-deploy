                  5G was one of the most exciting prospects as we entered this year. But this pandemic has
          brought a terrible impact on human lives as well as an economic downturn. For the global
          economic recovery we need organizations to be digitized and for this digital transformation
          connectivity plays a big role.The new global wireless standard 5G or the 5th generation mobile
          network is coming up by providing the users a plethora of services that include much faster
          speed, far more connected devices at a lower latency. During these times of technological
          advancement, 5G will impact almost all the industries including healthcare and transportation.

                  Most of the trending technologies including IoT, gaming, AR and VR experiences are looking
          forward to 5G networking technology for their advancements. All these developments require a
          huge amount of connectivity and networking which can be accomplished through Edge
          Computing. IoT is one of the best use case for edge computing since they usually require some
          intelligent gateway to filter and aggregate data coming in from sensor networks or to take any
          real-time action with respect to that data. In this context also edge computing can speed up the
          communications between edge devices and central systems

                        In this technological era one of the most important things that consumer demand is the digital
                experience. So for meeting all these demands 5G requires the support of edge cloud, which
                brings the data center physically closer to the end-users thereby reducing latency by bringing
                compute capabilities into the network.<br><br>
                Some of the technologies where 5G edge computing comes into play include: -</p>

            <ul class="jak-light blog-para pt-2" style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <li> For using IoT sensors in the remote areas without 5G coverage, one can adopt the 4G
                    along with edge computing to achieve the required and can be thus moved to 5G later.</li>
                    
                    <li>In the gaming industry which requires real-time experience the requirement of 5G
                    connectivity is very high. Here the edge computing along with a broader base of 4G
                    devices could help initially.</li>

                    <li> Manufacturing sectors were forced to close during the pandemic. By accelerating
                    digitization manufacturers can reduce cost, improve speed and quality.</li>
                    
                    <li>Healthcare is another sector that is going to get benefited with the advent of edge
                    computing and 5G. Monitoring of patients via sensors, collecting details and analysing
                    health conditions, all of these can be made easy with 5G and edge computing</li>
            </ul>

            5G provides the capability to support billions of connected devices transmitting huge volumes of
            data. Many of the developing arenas including Autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, transport
            and healthcare depend on instant data transfer. Compared to all the other generations 5G is a
            unified and more capable air interface, which delivers a lot of new services to the users.
            Anyways 5G and Edge Computing are two interconnected technologies that will enable us to
            process a huge amount of data at real-time moreover these are the two developing technologies
            that are going to bring a much bigger impact on the economy.
